# R package `PMS`


## Overview

PMS(Posterior Mean Screening) is a variable screening method constructed from the Bayesian framework. Different from other variable screening methods, the PMS method could incorporate both prior mean and prior covariance matrix information systematically. We construct the specific formulation of screening statistics under several different prior structures.
